# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-22)

**Core value:** Family members see every VkusVill discount and can add to cart in one tap
**Current focus:** no active milestone — awaiting next milestone kickoff

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.14 — Cart Truth & History Semantics — ARCHIVED (2026-04-22)
Phase: 55 (Live Verification & Release Decision) — COMPLETE
Plan: 1 of 1 — Complete
Status: v1.14 audited (`passed`), archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.14-*.md`, `MILESTONES.md` updated
Last activity: 2026-04-22 -- retroactive closure of v1.12, v1.13, v1.14 completed

## Milestone Goal

- Make MiniApp add-to-cart actually work for real users, not just in code-path theory
- Remove fake restock/reentry semantics from sale history and related user-visible flows
- Repair current persisted history data so already-recorded fake restocks/reentries disappear
- Verify cart and history behavior against fresh production-like evidence before treating the work as done

## Next Up

- `$gsd-new-milestone` — define the next milestone; no active scope right now
- Follow-ups tracked outside a formal milestone: 2026-04-22 scheduler SOCKS5 recv() deadlock hotfix (proxy_manager preflight + bounded as_completed + scheduler heartbeat watchdog) was shipped in commit `4c7f271` and is not represented in any v1.x milestone; consider folding into a future reliability milestone if similar issues recur

## Accumulated Context

- v1.2 shipped: Price History with 16K+ products, predictions, and detail analytics
- v1.4 shipped: ProxyManager centralization across backend/cart/login flows
- v1.5 shipped: search normalization, fuzzy Cyrillic search, lazy image enrichment
- v1.6 shipped: green scraper robustness with CDP modal loading + validation gates
- v1.7 shipped: group/subgroup hierarchy scraped, drill-down filters on main/history, category favorites, and Telegram category alerts
- v1.8 shipped: History search now covers the full local catalog during active queries and clearly labels mixed result states
- v1.9 shipped: supplemental catalog discovery/backfill now expands local search coverage with parity reporting and regression gates
- Auto-deploy is active via GitHub webhook → EC2 and Vercel frontend deploys
- Scheduler now runs full cycles on a 5-minute target with extra green-only refresh opportunities on a 1-minute target between them
- Sale sessions now stay continuous across transient misses and only close after 60 healthy minutes of absence
- New-item alerts now follow confirmed session reentry instead of first-ever-seen product IDs
- `/api/products` and `/admin/status` now expose per-source freshness and cycle-state visibility
- MiniApp now hydrates from the last good product payload and uses a lower-pressure enrichment queue for missing card metadata
- The milestone verification set now includes continuity, scheduler freshness, notifier, admin-status, history-search, catalog-merge, and API coverage together
- v1.10 archived to `.planning/milestones/` with roadmap, requirements, and audit snapshots

### Pending Todos

- Clarify stale banner freshness vs updated time — the stale warning is driven by per-color source age, while the header shows the latest merged payload time, so the UI currently looks contradictory even when backend freshness logic is correct.
- Consider a small reliability milestone to formalize the Apr 22 scheduler SOCKS5 deadlock fix (commit `4c7f271`), extract learnings, and extend the proxy/preflight regression coverage so future hangs are caught sooner.

## Known Bugs

- (none open — the three bugs previously listed here were fixed and verified by v1.14: cart add now works live, history no longer fakes reentries, and persisted data was repaired)
