# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-21)

**Core value:** Family members see every VkusVill discount and can add to cart in one tap
**Current focus:** v1.14 milestone setup — fix real cart truth and fake history/restock semantics

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.14 — Cart Truth & History Semantics
Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements and roadmap for unresolved cart/history truth bugs
Last activity: 2026-04-21 -- Milestone v1.14 started

## Milestone Goal

- Make MiniApp add-to-cart actually work for real users, not just in code-path theory
- Remove fake restock/reentry semantics from sale history and related user-visible flows
- Repair current persisted history data so already-recorded fake restocks/reentries disappear
- Verify cart and history behavior against fresh production-like evidence before treating the work as done

## Next Up

- `$gsd-discuss-phase 52` — gather context for real cart-failure reproduction and diagnostics

## Accumulated Context

- v1.2 shipped: Price History with 16K+ products, predictions, and detail analytics
- v1.4 shipped: ProxyManager centralization across backend/cart/login flows
- v1.5 shipped: search normalization, fuzzy Cyrillic search, lazy image enrichment
- v1.6 shipped: green scraper robustness with CDP modal loading + validation gates
- v1.7 shipped: group/subgroup hierarchy scraped, drill-down filters on main/history, category favorites, and Telegram category alerts
- v1.8 shipped: History search now covers the full local catalog during active queries and clearly labels mixed result states
- v1.9 shipped: supplemental catalog discovery/backfill now expands local search coverage with parity reporting and regression gates
- Auto-deploy is active via GitHub webhook → EC2 and Vercel frontend deploys
- Scheduler now runs full cycles on a 5-minute target with extra green-only refresh opportunities on a 1-minute target between them
- Sale sessions now stay continuous across transient misses and only close after 60 healthy minutes of absence
- New-item alerts now follow confirmed session reentry instead of first-ever-seen product IDs
- `/api/products` and `/admin/status` now expose per-source freshness and cycle-state visibility
- MiniApp now hydrates from the last good product payload and uses a lower-pressure enrichment queue for missing card metadata
- The milestone verification set now includes continuity, scheduler freshness, notifier, admin-status, history-search, catalog-merge, and API coverage together
- v1.10 archived to `.planning/milestones/` with roadmap, requirements, and audit snapshots

### Pending Todos

- Clarify stale banner freshness vs updated time — the stale warning is driven by per-color source age, while the header shows the latest merged payload time, so the UI currently looks contradictory even when backend freshness logic is correct.

## Known Bugs

- Add-to-cart still does not reliably place products into the real VkusVill cart in live user flows
- History still appears to create fake restocks/reentries instead of only reflecting true sale return
- Current persisted history data already contains fake restock/reentry artifacts that need cleanup, not just forward-looking logic fixes
