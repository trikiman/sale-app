# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-06)

**Core value:** Family members see every VkusVill discount and can add to cart in one tap
**Current focus:** Kick off Phase 43 so backend cart-add responses stop dragging through inline recovery and the 5-second frontend budget has a clean contract to target

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.11 — Cart Responsiveness & Truth Recovery
Phase: 43 ready to start
Plan: —
Status: Milestone defined, ready for phase planning
Last activity: 2026-04-06

## Milestone Goal

- Stop add-to-cart from keeping the user in a loading state longer than 5 seconds
- Move cart truth reconciliation after ambiguous timeouts into a background path instead of chaining extra waits inside one click
- Tighten backend cart/session recovery so slow upstream behavior does not stretch the visible user wait budget
- Make slow-add latency, timeout causes, and reconciliation outcomes visible enough to debug confidently

## Next Up

- `$gsd-discuss-phase 43` — gather context for the backend cart response contract
- `$gsd-plan-phase 43` — skip discussion and plan Phase 43 directly

## Accumulated Context

- v1.2 shipped: Price History with 16K+ products, predictions, and detail analytics
- v1.4 shipped: ProxyManager centralization across backend/cart/login flows
- v1.5 shipped: search normalization, fuzzy Cyrillic search, lazy image enrichment
- v1.6 shipped: green scraper robustness with CDP modal loading + validation gates
- v1.7 shipped: group/subgroup hierarchy scraped, drill-down filters on main/history, category favorites, and Telegram category alerts
- v1.8 shipped: History search now covers the full local catalog during active queries and clearly labels mixed result states
- v1.9 shipped: supplemental catalog discovery/backfill now expands local search coverage with parity reporting and regression gates
- Auto-deploy is active via GitHub webhook → EC2 and Vercel frontend deploys
- Scheduler now runs full cycles on a 5-minute target with extra green-only refresh opportunities on a 1-minute target between them
- Sale sessions now stay continuous across transient misses and only close after 60 healthy minutes of absence
- New-item alerts now follow confirmed session reentry instead of first-ever-seen product IDs
- `/api/products` and `/admin/status` now expose per-source freshness and cycle-state visibility
- MiniApp now hydrates from the last good product payload and uses a lower-pressure enrichment queue for missing card metadata
- The milestone verification set now includes continuity, scheduler freshness, notifier, admin-status, history-search, catalog-merge, and API coverage together
- v1.10 archived to `.planning/milestones/` with roadmap, requirements, and audit snapshots

### Pending Todos

- Clarify stale banner freshness vs updated time — the stale warning is driven by per-color source age, while the header shows the latest merged payload time, so the UI currently looks contradictory even when backend freshness logic is correct.

## Known Bugs

- Add-to-cart can still feel stuck well past 5 seconds because the frontend timeout path continues into extra cart refresh/reconciliation work while VkusVill add requests may complete late upstream
